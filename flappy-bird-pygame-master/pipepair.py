    A PipePair has a top and a bottom pipe, and only between them can
    the bird pass -- if it collides with either part, the game is over.

    Attributes:
    x: The PipePair's X position.  This is a float, to make movement
        smoother.  Note that there is no y attribute, as it will only
        ever be 0.
    image: A pygame.Surface which can be blitted to the display surface
        to display the PipePair.
    mask: A bitmask which excludes all pixels in self.image with a
        transparency greater than 127.  This can be used for collision
        detection.
    top_pieces: The number of pieces, including the end piece, in the
        top pipe.
    bottom_pieces: The number of pieces, including the end piece, in
        the bottom pipe.

    Constants:
    WIDTH: The width, in pixels, of a pipe piece.  Because a pipe is
        only one piece wide, this is also the width of a PipePair's
        image.
    PIECE_HEIGHT: The height, in pixels, of a pipe piece.
    ADD_INTERVAL: The interval, in milliseconds, in between adding new
        pipes.
